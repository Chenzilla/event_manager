# event_manager
An exercise in IO manipulation, this script takes in a CSV of various data one might expect to be collected at a conference. Using this data, as well as the Sunlight Congress API and Sunglight gem, we generate an HTML template that can be emailed to attendees. This template is populated based on the information provided at the conference, which is also used to find each participant's local congressmen/congresswomen as well as their phone numbers in order to create a call to action.
